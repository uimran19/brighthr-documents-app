## Description

A documents app which allows users to view stored files, which may be categorised in folders. Users can filter by file name and sort by name/date.

## Final thoughts

#### What if the data contained deeply nested folders?

Immediately recursion comes to mind as there may be an indefinite number of nested folders. The recursive function would cease to invoke itself once it reaches a folder with no child folder.

Overall, this was a fun task to complete and I appreciate the opportunity to have partaken in this assessment. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
